# Chain of Thought Reasoning Prompt
CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PROMPT = """ANALYTICAL REASONING PROTOCOL:

For complex queries requiring interpretation, follow this step-by-step approach:

STEP 1: Document Analysis
"Let me examine the relevant document sections for your query..."

STEP 2: Information Identification
"I can identify the following key information from the documents..."

STEP 3: Contextual Application
"Applying this information to your specific situation..."

STEP 4: Definitive Answer
"Based on this analysis, the answer is..."

EXAMPLE REASONING:
Query: "Am I covered for surgery if I have a pre-existing condition diagnosed 2 years ago?"

Step 1: "Let me examine the pre-existing disease coverage clause in your policy..."
Step 2: "The policy states there is a waiting period of thirty-six (36) months for pre-existing diseases..."
Step 3: "Since your condition was diagnosed 2 years ago and you need coverage now..."
Step 4: "Therefore, the surgery would not be covered as you haven't completed the required 36-month waiting period."

Apply this reasoning approach to the query."""

# Accuracy Validation Prompt

RED FLAGS - Double-check when you see:
- Round numbers that might be approximations
- Conditional language ("may," "could," "typically")
- Cross-references to other sections
- Time-sensitive or deadline-related provisions

Validate your response against these criteria before final delivery."""

# Error Prevention System
ERROR_PREVENTION_PROMPT = """ERROR PREVENTION AND QUALITY CONTROL:

COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
1. Approximating numbers instead of using exact values
2. Omitting conditional requirements or exceptions
3. Using generic language instead of specific document terms
4. Failing to identify cross-references or dependencies
5. Providing incomplete answers that miss query aspects

ACCURACY SAFEGUARDS:
- Always use exact numerical values from source documents
- Include all conditional phrases ("subject to," "provided that," "except where")
- Preserve original document formatting and terminology
- Cross-reference related sections before finalizing response
- Validate that response directly addresses the specific query

VERIFICATION QUESTIONS:
- Does my response include exact numbers/timeframes?
- Have I included all relevant conditions?
- Does my language match the source document precision?
- Have I addressed every part of the user's query?
- Is there any ambiguity that needs clarification?

Apply these safeguards to ensure response accuracy."""

# Context-Aware Processing
CONTEXT_AWARE_PROMPT = """CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL:

CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Document hierarchy and section relationships
2. Cross-references between different policy sections
3. Temporal factors (effective dates, expiration, updates)
4. Conditional dependencies and prerequisites
5. Jurisdictional or regulatory variations

CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS STEPS:
- Identify the primary information source
- Check for related sections or clauses
- Note any overriding conditions or exceptions
- Consider temporal applicability
- Account for hierarchical policy structure

EXAMPLE CONTEXTUAL PROCESSING:
Query: "What is my coverage limit?"
Context Check: 
- Base policy limit: $100,000
- Enhancement riders: Additional $50,000
- Deductible impacts: $5,000 per claim
- Effective date considerations: Policy year 2
- Final Answer: "Your coverage limit is $150,000 ($100,000 base + $50,000 rider enhancement), subject to a $5,000 deductible per claim."
